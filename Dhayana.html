                This is the seventh part of Ashtanga yoga. Mind must be doing this work
                during the whole time of meditation without deviation. Beginners will be having
                the experience of deviation of mind several times. Then push out other
                thoughts if any in the mind and again bring the given work again. Meditation
                can be done silently or with sound. Silent meditation is not disturbing any one.
                Therefore it can be done anywhere. Sound meditation will help us to avoid
                outside sound and we get more concentration. After attaining concentration,
                chakra meditation can be practiced by bringing mind on each chakra. This will
                enable us to control the function of each chakra to stop and start according to
                our will. Soonya meditation is deeper than this which is making the conscious
                level of mind sleep. Then the mind will be like surface of water without ripples
                or flame of candle where there is no wind. In this level as the conscious level
                is not working, we can enter into the subconscious level of mind to understand
                who we are, what we were and what we will become. This is self realization.
                But this level is not easy to reach. The immediate result we can enjoy is
                another. One who is practicing meditation for even two or three years can have
                a mind always with positive thoughts, which will bring only happiness. Negative
                thoughts like anxiety, fear, prejudice, hatred etc. will bring only worries. For any
                new thing the mind has four steps registration, categorization, stimulation and
                reaction. One who is practicing meditation will not give reaction for a negative
                stimulus. Then the mind gets a gap between stimulus and reaction and mind
                moves slowly to positive side. The reaction for a negative stimulus will be
                unhealthy, while positive stimulus will tempt for healthy reaction.
