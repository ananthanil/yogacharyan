    			Yoga is not a mere exercise. It is a life style. Just like
                brushing the teeth daily, yoga also must be a part of our life. Then
                only it is beneficial. Yoga can be practiced early in the morning or in
                the evening or both time. If after a meal wait for 2:30 hours. Empty
                the bowels and bladder if needed, wear minimum cotton cloths, use
                mat or sheet and do the exercises either in a well ventilated room or
                open space. Most of the exercises are connected with breathing and
                must be done synchronized with breathing very slowly. Each item can
                be repeated according to the time schedule allotted for exercises; but
                never get exhausted by exercise. For saving time it is advisable to
                repeat each item three or five times if it is a movement, and for still
                items take three or five breathing for each. If after a major operation,
                yoga can be started after one year. When feeling ill, should not
                practice yoga and take rest. Ladies must avoid yoga during menstrual
                period and after three months of pregnancy. They can start yoga
                three months after delivery. During pregnancy they can have some
                selected items of yoga prescribed by a master which will help them for
                a natural delivery. Better results can be attained by taking vegetarian
                diet and avoiding tobacco in any form and alcohol. Do not attempt
                difficult items by giving strain to the body. Do any item only up to the
                level of the flexibility of the body, The body will attain more flexibility
                and then difficult postures also can be practiced later.
