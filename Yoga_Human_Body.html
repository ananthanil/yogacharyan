                Human body is made of five primary elements namely earth, water, fire,
                air and ether. There are five kosas- annamaya the body, pranamaya the
                life, manomaya the mind, vijnanamaya the knowledge and anandamaya
                the bliss. By taking food and water we develop annamaya kosa. By
                pranayama (controlled breathing) pranamaya kosa is developing.
                Dhyana (meditation) improves manomaya kosa. Progress in mediation
                leads to formation of sixth sense- intuition by which we can get the
                maximum possible knowledge in this world. Thus vijnanamaya kosa is
                developed. When we feel that there is nothing more to understand in this
                world, we enjoy the ultimate pleasure and thus the anandamaya kosa is
                also opened.

                There are three energies working in us. Jeevatma is the life (bio
                magnetic energy), Chitha the mind (conscious energy) and Paramatma
                the subconscious mind (cosmic energy). Yoga the word means uniting
                together. Here Jeevatma is united with Paramatma. This union is
                possible only after de- functioning mind, which is working as a security in
                between Jeevatma and Paramatma. Pathanjaly the great sage who
                designed ashtanga yoga gives this as "yogaschithavrithinirodha". When
                we get access to the sub conscious level of mind actually the individual
                soul is getting connected with the supreme soul and this will be helping
                us to unveil the secrets of this universe. This reveals the past, present
                and future of our own life. This is termed as self realization which is the
                ultimate aim of yoga.

                Human body is made of five primary elements viz. earth, water, air, fire
                and ether. We will never attempt to repair wooden furniture with cement
                or iron. Just like that human body must be refreshed by the five
                elements mentioned above. In this case earth we utilize as food. Water is
                used for drinking and baths, air for breathing and fire from sun light. But
                we are not thinking about ether. If we are living with nature, the nature
                will be providing the facilities for refreshing the body with all the five
                elements and we will be healthy. This is why the animals in the forest are
                not having any veterinary doctor to treat them. As we are living against
                nature in many aspects, due to the imbalance of our life style, unwanted
                things are accumulating in our body. The body will be tolerating this for a
                long time and is waiting for a convenient time to react against it. The
                reaction will be in the form of a fever or head ache. This is a sewage
                work. For the digestion of a full belly food, the body is utilizing about
                90% of its energy. Hence the body cannot undertake any sewage work
                when we take three times meals without break. There for the important
                symptom of a fever is not having appetite and taste of food. If you accept
                the demand of the body and take no food, the stomach becomes empty
                and this time ether is used for refreshing the body. We cannot undertake
                the work of cooking when we clean the kitchen.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we allow the fever to run its course by taking rest and not eating, the
                body will be rectifying all the defects and help us to restore good health,
                But we have no time to wait for seven days for this. We go to a doctor for
                the treatment. Doctor prescribes some medicines which must be taken
                after food. When food enters the stomach, the body cannot go on with
                the sewage work and then the symptoms of the fever disappear and the
                body is turning to digestion work. Thus you suppress the fever not
                satisfying the necessity of the body. The body will be waiting for another
                chance and the rectification will be appearing as another disease. Thus
                the medicine was not curing the disease but was changing it as another
                disease.

            <p>
                Instead of waiting for the body to start its rectification process with a
                fever, we can help the body in this matter by providing the circumstances
                for this by taking a fasting for one day fortnightly. On fasting day we
                must drink more water, especially at the times of meals. In meal time the
                digestive juices injected to the stomach by the body must be diluted.
                Otherwise they will be corroding the walls of the stomach resulting to
                gastric ulcer. Moreover the first meal taking for breaking the fast on the
                next day must not be heavy. The old people of India were selecting the
                eleventh day after the full moon and new moon for fasting as they
                understood that the eleventh day is connected with digestion. As this
                need not come on a holiday, the employed people can have a convenient
                holiday for this.

                <b>Good Habits of Eating</b>
            </div>
            <p>
                Keeping healthy habits of eating will help us in a large extent to minimize
                the imbalance of food. Drink your solids and eat your liquids. Solids must
                be chewed well to mix it with saliva and then you can drink it. Liquids
                must be kept in the mouth for a few seconds to mix it with saliva and then
                gulp it. By chewing the solids the digestive juice gets more area for
                attack. There is no chewing mechanism (teeth) below the mouth,
                Number of times of meals a day also must be limited to two times with
                breakfast and lunch. During night time the digestion is very low. The day
                beings stop eating by twilight. If you are so particular to take dinner, take
                it before sunset and it must be very light. It is better to take one time
                meal without cooking because some of the very important things like
                insulin evaporate when heated above 100 degree Celsius. If you take
                cooked and uncooked together, take the uncooked first and the cooked
                must be following it. If you take water just before and along with the
                meals, it will dilute the digestive juice and it will not be strong enough to
                attack the food material successfully. Take water either one hour before
                or one hour after the meals.

                Nose is placed near the mouth to understand the smell of the food. Cow
                understands the eatable grass not by seeing it, but by smelling it. Think
                of the nasty smell of a fish market from where you buy your food.
                Actually it is not good smelling. By adding spices you change its flavor
                and then eat it. If you see a dead ant inside a cup of tea, you will not use
                it due to presence of dead body in it. It is fantastic that you accept a large
                dead body of a fish as your food material. The shape and arrangement of
                human teeth are also not apt for meat eating. The vegetarian meals that
                we take will be digested by 24 hours and the waste will be thrown out
                after that. But the non vegetarian meals digest by 18 hours and the
                waste will be kept inside the abdomen for 6 more hours. During this time
                the body will be absorbing many unwanted things from it causing
                accumulation of more fat resulting to overweight. Use of alcohol
                deteriorates the efficiency of nervous system. This is dangerous than
                death.
