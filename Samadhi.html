                Samadhi means equal feeling. By getting this stage the mind comes to a
                higher level where there is no dual feeling. This is the eighth part of Ashtanga
                yoga. After getting concentration and discipline of mind we get control over
                each chakra. And by Samadhi one can abstain from life for a time being or
                forever. In Savikalpasamadhi the practitioner can return from Samadhi to life
                after a few days. When he feels that his work in this world is finished he can
                take Nirvikalpasamadhi which is equal to death.
