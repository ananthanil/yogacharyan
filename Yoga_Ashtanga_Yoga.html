                            <b>What is Ashtanga Yoga ?</b>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            We are not able to trace the origin of yoga in India. In Vedas there is
                            reference of yoga. About five thousand years before a sage named
                            Pathanjali divided then yoga into eight parts. Thus the name ashtanga
                            came into existence. Ashta means eight and anga means part. The first
                            part is <b>Yama</b> having five things which were designed for the smooth
                            running of the society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (1)<b>Non violence</b>:- In word deed or thought we should not be violent
                            towards any living being. Living being is defined as any one that starts its
                            life, lives a life of any duration and finally perishes. Killing is violence. But
                            mental torture is more violent than killing, as its effect is longer than the
                            other. When we become angry or violent the negative hormones
                            produced in our body will aggravate the conditions of any disease in us.
                            Thus the angry man and the object of anger are both troubled by this
                            action.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (2)<b>Truth</b>:- This is defined as anything giving benefit to a living being. 
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (3)<b>Non- stealing</b>:- Not taking possession of a thing without the permission of its owner. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (4)<b>Controlled use of sex</b>:- It is only for the preparation of next generation and not for lust.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (5)<b>Not desiring to take possession of all things that come across</b>:- When we desire to get a thing and not getting it, we will be disappointed. When we are not expecting anything, that which we get will be a great thing and this will lead to a contented life.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            <b>Niyama </b>the second part also have five things.
                        </P>
                        
                        <p>
                            (1)<b>Cleanliness</b>:- We must keep our body, dress and surroundings clean.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (2)<b>Pleasant expression</b>:- We must be always please looking and never be gloomy.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (3)<b>Penance</b>:- We must be ready to undertake any hard work for attaining the goal.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (4)<b>Learning the past</b>:- Learning the past history is essential for understanding the achievements of our predecessors. This will help us to proceed our work easily.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            (5)<b>Bestowing everything up on God</b>:- We must understand God as the energy working in us and feel that all that we do is done by God. This feeling will help us to avoid worries connected with our failures because the failure or success is not ours. Therefore we are not excited by the success also.
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            After Yama and Niyama the third part is <b>Asanas</b>
                        </P>

                        <p>
                        This includes Postures, Bendhas, Kriyas and Mudras.
                        </P>

                    If it is for maintenance of good
                    health to lead a happy and contented life practice
                    of difficult yoga postures is not needed Warming
                    up the body with some easy preliminary exercises
                    a few postures of yoga by standing, sitting and
                    lying and some eye exercises, breathing exercises
                    (Pranayama) and abdomen exercises can be
                    practiced by 20 or 25 minutes. This website is not
                    designed as a guide for beginners. They must get
                    the help of a master because the website is not
                    capable of making any corrections when the
                    beginner is going wrong. More over the
                    practitioner will be always doubtful regarding the
                    correctness of his postures. When a master gives
                    confidence by commenting, the beginner will have
                    a psychological effect. Unlike other methods, yoga
                    is giving exercises for all parts of body. This needs
                    no equipments. Therefor this can be practiced
                    anywhere in the world if we get six feet space.
