                <b>Positive and Negative Foods</b>
            </div>

            <p>
                The food that we take has great influence on the thought. If we take
                positive food, our thought also will be always positive and keep our body
                and mind healthy. The nature has provided food for all living beings
                around them. In the forest, there are many animals. Each animal will
                take only the food allotted by the nature. A lion will not take the grass of
                a deer or fruits of a monkey. The monkey or deer will never take the meat
                of an animal which is the food of a lion. They all are leading a very
                healthy life and need not have the help of a doctor for treatment of any
                disease. The domestic animals get diseased by taking the artificial food
                we give. How can we distinguish between positive and negative food?            
            </p>

                Getting the sight or smell of some food like jack fruit, pineapple, mango,
                water will be coming to the mouth. We will not get this experience by
                seeing a fish in the aquarium or a goat on the wayside. The water in the
                mouth is the first digestive juice. The body is getting ready for digesting
                the food if you take that positive food. But the body is not reacting by the
                sight of fish or goat. It is not our food. A lion by the sight of a goat will
                have the saliva in his mouth. It is his food. By the sight of pineapple he
                will not get salivation. Thus the body is distinguishing the positive and
                negative food.

                A yogi, who is practicing yoga all his life, needs only one meal a day and it
                can be lunch. All others can have two meals, breakfast and lunch. By
                taking three meals we actually get diseased. Night eating is not good.
                We are day beings. During night digestion is low. The meals we take
                during night will not be fully digested and will cause diseases. Even the
                day birds stop their eating by sunset and go to their nests. When the
                stomach is full the body will give a sign to stop eating with a belching. If
                you continue to eat, another belching will warn you not to eat. A third
                belching will bring some food also with it to the mouth.
