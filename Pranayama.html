            <p>
                This is the fourth part of Ashtanga Yoga. When we breath we assimilate
                oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. This is the physiological aspect of
                breathing. In yoga there is one more aspect. We are receiving cosmic
                energy and convert it into bio -magnetic energy. This is our life energy
                which we store in seven energy points on our body called Chakras. Five
                of these points are on spinal cord which is a continuation of brain
                coming down to the end of back bone. This is the first point namely
                Mooladhara (base chakra). Its prime function is excretion and is in the
                shape of lotus with four red petals. The second behind the sex organ is
                Swadhishtana (sex chakra). It has six petals of orange colour and its
                function is reproduction. Till the age of puberty it will be in dormant
                stage. Manipooraka the third is behind the navel (navel chakra) has ten
                yellow petals and its prime function is assimilation. Anahatha (heart
                chakra) has twelve green petals and it is the point of higher emotions.
                Unkind people are called heartless because this chakra is not properly
                activated in them. Hearty congratulation and hearty welcome are
                emerging from this point. The fifth point Visudhi (throat chakra) is the
                point of speech and language having sixteen blue petals. Ajna the (eye
                brow chakra) at the middle of eye brows having two indigo petals is the
                point of reasoning power. Sahasrara the seventh (crown chakra) with
                thousand violet petals is at the top of the head. This point can be
                activated only with yoga and meditation and helps us in self realization
                which is the ultimate aim of yoga.

                Pranayama has four steps. Pooraka (breath in), anthara kumbhaka
                (hold in), Rechaka (breath out) and Bahyakumbhaka (hold out).
                Beginners are given only two steps breath in and breath out in 1:2
                by adjusting breathing out time nearly double the breathing in
                can be 3+6 or 4+8. The second step can be taken after few weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here holding in also introduced and the exercise is given as 4+4+4,
                four seconds to breath in four seconds to hold in and four seconds to
                breath out. After some weeks the holding time and breathing out time
                can be increased, as 4+5+5...4+6+6...4+7+7and 4+8+8. The holding time
                can be increased further as 4+9+8.4+10+8.... up to 4+16+8.
            </p>

            <p>
                When introducing holding out time it starts by 4+4+4+4 and can be enhanced
                up to 4+8+8+4. Five vayus and five upavayus are working in the body. Prana,
                udana, apana, samana and vyana are the main vayus. The first four are
                working in heart, throat base and navel chakras respectively. Vyana the fifth
                spreads all over the body. The upavayus naga, koorma, krikara, devadetha and
                dhananjaya are helping to belching, blinking, sneezing and yawning etc. The
                four steps of pranayama are used for activating four chakras with the help of
                three bandhas. Keeping mind on heart chakra, breathe in filling the lungs fully
                feeling that heart chakra is activated by Prana. When holding in, Jalandhara
                bandha is taken feeling that throat chakra is activated by Udana. By breathing
                out bend the body forward to press the abdomen and hold Moola bandha
                feeling that base chakra is activated by Apana. Then hold out taking Uddiyana
                bandha feeling that navel chakra is activated by Samana.

                In yoga different pranayamas are used for different purposes. (1) Soorya bhedi/
                Chandra bhedi :- Soorya bhedi is breathing only through right nostril for heating
                the body and Chandra bhedi is breathing through left nostril for cooling the
                body. (2) Ujjayi for cleaning the throat by making a sound by rubbing the throat
                when breathe out. (3) Seelkari is breathing out through the gap of the teeth
                with a hissing sound. (4)Seethali is to cool the brain by breathing in through a
                pipe of the tongue. (5) Bhramari is used to tune the brain. This is done by
                breathing out with a humming sound blocking the ears with fingers to avoid
                outside sounds and keeping a small gap between the teeth to avoid vibration of
                it. (6) Bhasthrika for consumption of more oxygen. In this we start with 4+4 and
                then take speed as 3+3...2+2...1+1...1/2+1/2...1/4+14... and then changing to
                4+4 3+3 and so on. (7) Moorcha is keeping air inside as far as possible after
                breathing in. (8) Plavini is used for floating on water by breathing out only a part
                of the air as 4.2.

                    If it is for maintenance of good
                    health to lead a happy and contented life practice
                    of difficult yoga postures is not needed Warming
                    up the body with some easy preliminary exercises
                    a few postures of yoga by standing, sitting and
                    lying and some eye exercises, breathing exercises
                    (Pranayama) and abdomen exercises can be
                    practiced by 20 or 25 minutes. This website is not
                    designed as a guide for beginners. They must get
                    the help of a master because the website is not
                    capable of making any corrections when the
                    beginner is going wrong. More over the
                    practitioner will be always doubtful regarding the
                    correctness of his postures. When a master gives
                    confidence by commenting, the beginner will have
                    a psychological effect. Unlike other methods, yoga
                    is giving exercises for all parts of body. This needs
                    no equipments. Therefor this can be practiced
                    anywhere in the world if we get six feet space.
